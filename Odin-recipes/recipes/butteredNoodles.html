        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Buttered noodles are simple to make with your favorite pasta, butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper for a quick and easy, kid-friendly dish. 
            Fresh herbs and a little lemon juice could be added to amp up the flavor.
            Perfect to serve either as-is or alongside steak, chicken, or meatballs.
            It's such a delicious recipe, yet I get many questions on how to make it.</p>
